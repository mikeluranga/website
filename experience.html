<h1>Experience</h1>
  <p>
    Over the last decade, I’ve led data, analytics, and customer intelligence functions in complex international environments, helping organizations move beyond dashboards and reporting into truly data-driven decision-making. My work has consistently focused on building the teams, platforms, strategy, and governance that enable companies to understand their customers better, operate smarter, and grow faster.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’ve had the responsibility of defining data strategies from the ground up, shaping analytics operating models, and transforming fragmented capabilities into scalable, enterprise-level ecosystems. This has included leading multidisciplinary teams, partnering with senior leadership across marketing, digital, product, finance, and IT, and ensuring that data becomes an everyday tool for decision-makers rather than a specialist asset.
  </p>
  <p>
    A large part of my experience has been dedicated to connecting strategy with execution: translating business goals into data initiatives, turning complex customer behavior into actionable intelligence, and ensuring analytics delivers measurable business outcomes. I’ve worked extensively on loyalty, CRM, personalization, customer lifetime value, performance measurement, and the design of advanced analytics capabilities that empower organizations to move from reactive reporting to proactive decisioning.
  </p>
  <p>
    Along the way, I’ve built and scaled analytics teams, internalized critical capabilities previously outsourced, and delivered significant improvements in speed, reliability, cost efficiency, and impact. I’m particularly passionate about creating clarity—simplifying architectures, designing systems that people actually use, and ensuring that executives, marketers, product leaders, and frontline teams can confidently rely on data to guide what they do next.
  </p>
  <p>
    Today, my work continues to sit at the intersection of <strong>data architecture, analytics engineering, data strategy, and leadership</strong>—helping organizations build the foundations they need to make better decisions, personalize smarter, and understand their customers in meaningful ways.
